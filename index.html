          Hello! I’m Tyler Schrimper, a music producer and music engineer
          currently studying communications at UNC Chapel Hill. My passion lies
          in crafting immersive audio experiences and pairing them with
          compelling visuals. Whether I’m mixing tracks in the studio or
          illustrating an infographic in Adobe InDesign or Illustrator, I strive
          to tell stories that resonate. Below you’ll find examples of my
          design work as well as a sample of my music production.

            <h3>Addiction Infographic</h3>
            <p>
              A two‑page spread examining the science behind social media
              addiction and the methods platforms use to keep users engaged.
              Designed using Adobe InDesign and Illustrator, this piece
              demonstrates my ability to organize complex information into a
              clear, compelling layout. Custom vector icons and typographic
              hierarchy guide the reader through the narrative.

            <h3>Poison Dart Frogs</h3>
            <p>
              An illustrated research spread about the world’s most poisonous
              organisms. Combining hand‑drawn artwork, Photoshop compositing
              and Illustrator, this design showcases creative illustration
              techniques alongside disciplined information design. The result is
              an engaging educational piece with scientific accuracy.

          Outside of design, I spend my time producing and engineering music.
          Below is a recent track that highlights my approach to composition,
          arrangement and mixing. Put on some headphones and enjoy!
